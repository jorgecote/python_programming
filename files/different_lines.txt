Alice was
beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
sister
on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once
or twice she had peeped into the book her sister
was reading, but it had
no
pictures or conversations in it,"and what is
the use of a book," thought Alice, "without
pictures or conversations?"

Alice's restlessness 
continued to grow as she watched her sister
engrossed in her book, seemingly oblivious to 
the beautiful surroundings around them. 
She yearned for adventure and excitement, 
and the mundane routine of sitting on the bank 
was beginning to weigh on her. 
Alice longed for a world that was vibrant, 
imaginative and filled with wonder, 
a world that was brimming with possibilities. 
As she gazed up at the sky, 
she couldn't help but feel that there must be more to life than what she was experiencing in that moment. 
And so, with a sense of restlessness and curiosity burning within her, 
Alice began to wonder what exciting adventures lay just beyond the horizon.
